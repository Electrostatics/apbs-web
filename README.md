## Overview
This project serves as the web interface for the APBS [web server](http://server.poissonboltzmann.org/).  The backend systems powering the interface and the main repository for this project lives in the [APBS-REST](https://github.com/Electrostatics/apbs-rest) repository.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

Prior to launching, a script is run to convert the environment variables from [env/.env](env/.env) to variables used by the website.

<!-- ### `npm start`

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](README_CREATEREACTAPP.md#running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Your app is ready to be deployed!
